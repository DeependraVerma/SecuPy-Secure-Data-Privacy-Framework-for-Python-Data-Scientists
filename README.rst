secure-learn is an all-in-one Python package designed to address data privacy and security concerns for data scientists. Developed by [Deependra Verma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deependra-verma-data-science/), secure-learn offers robust encryption, anonymization, and access control tools, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data.

## Introduction

secure-learn: Your all-in-one Python package for robust data privacy and security. Encrypt, anonymize, and control access to sensitive data effortlessly.

## Features

### secure-learn provides the following key methods:
- `encrypt_data(data)`: Encrypts sensitive data to ensure confidentiality.
- `decrypt_data(encrypted_data)`: Decrypts encrypted data to its original form.
- `anonymize_data(data, columns_to_anonymize)`: Anonymizes specific columns in a DataFrame.
- `add_role(role_name, permissions)`: Adds a new role with associated permissions to the access control system.
- `check_permission(role_name, permission)`: Checks if a role has the specified permission.

## Installation

To install secure-learn, simply run:

```bash
pip install secure-learn
```

Alternatively, you can clone the GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DeependraVerma/SecuPy-Secure-Data-Privacy-Framework-for-Python-Data-Scientists.git
cd SecuPy-Secure-Data-Privacy-Framework-for-Python-Data-Scientists
python setup.py install
```

## Dependencies

secure-learn relies on the following dependencies:
- `pandas>=1.0.0`
- `faker>=8.0.0`
- `cryptography>=3.0`

## Usage


# Import the package
from PrivacyPy import DataPrivacyFramework

# Initialize PrivacyPy with encryption key
encryption_key = "your_encryption_key"
privacy_framework = DataPrivacyFramework(encryption_key)

# Anonymize sensitive columns (Name, Email)
anonymized_df = privacy_framework.anonymize_data(data, ['Name', 'Email'])

# Encrypt entire DataFrame
encrypted_df = privacy_framework.encrypt_data(anonymized_df)
print("Encrypted DataFrame:")
print(encrypted_df)


## Users Benefit

secure-learn empowers data scientists with the following benefits:
- **Data Confidentiality:** Encrypt sensitive data to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Anonymization:** Anonymize personally identifiable information for privacy protection.
- **Access Control:** Control data access based on user roles and permissions.
- **Compliance:** Ensure compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

## Use Cases

secure-learn can be used in various data science scenarios, including:
- Healthcare data analysis
- Financial data processing
- User authentication systems
- Research collaborations with external parties
